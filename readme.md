# If you want to buy me a coffee you can. 
I don't expect anything for my work and if you are thinking of donating you should consider donating the main developers of HKI or UNRAID-API. 
I don't drink beer, I don't like going outside because I might catch something, so if you want to buy me a coffee I would greatly appreciate it.
